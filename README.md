# Unified XUL Platform (UXP)

This repository holds the code for a unified application platform for XUL-based
applications. It is a hard fork from the Mozilla code repository (mozilla-central)
with an ESR-52 fork point.

In addition to further development based on the Mozilla upstream code, and
selective cherry-picking of directly-applicable patches, this repository has its
own development and holds the base for a future platform to be used by XUL
applications.

This repository will contain at least one application to demonstrate and make use
of the platform: The Basilisk web browser, a close twin to Mozilla's Firefox.
