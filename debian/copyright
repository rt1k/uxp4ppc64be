Even though Pale Moon is open source and the source is supplied under
the Mozilla Public License, redistribution of the Pale Moon binaries is
limited by certain conditions under a proprietary license by Moonchild
Productions, as permitted under 3.2b of the MPL v2.0. This has been
required because of, among other things, the increasing number of
rogue/altered copies and people taking advantage of the free
availability of the browser to monetize upon, which is against Pale
Moon's principles of free software.

**** Redistribution license ****
Last updated: 14 September 2015

If you wish to redistribute the binaries (executable form of the code) of Pale
Moon, you are free to do so, with the following limitations:
   1. There is NO CHARGE for the download or distribution of the browser
      package.
      It is therefore not permitted if, without limitation:
         a. You charge for the download of the binary packages (e.g. paid
            hosting service, pay-per-download, subscription, etc.) or access to
            them (password protected sites/archives/etc.)
         b. You charge for redistribution rights of the browser binaries,
            yourself (you have no rights to it)
         c. You charge for a physical medium like a CD or DVD. Example: If you
            provide a "cover disk" with a printed magazine, that is considered
            a "no charge" item (free bonus item with the magazine) and is
            therefore allowed. If you provide a disk-based magazine (digital)
            that includes Pale Moon, the medium itself is paid for and
            considered a "charge" item, and is therefore not allowed.
   2. You don't require the obligatory submission of personal data (name, e-
      mail, telephone number, address, age, gender, ID, or similar) to download
      the binaries. If you require registration of users before they can
      download Pale Moon, you are not allowed to distribute it. Users must, at
      all times, have the clear and equal option to download Pale Moon without
      surrendering any personal information to you.
   3. The binaries and/or archives are completely UNALTERED. This includes
      addition or removal of any component of the browser. Redistribution is
      therefore not permitted if, without limitation:
         a. You have re-packed the browser in a different archive format
            (either common or proprietary)
            (an exception to this is re-packaging required for specific target
            operating systems, e.g. rpm, deb, pet)
         b. You have added language packs/add-ons/plugins/etc.
         c. You have added third-party tools/toolbars/utilities/etc.
         d. You have changed supplied default preferences of the browser
         e. You include a pre-set profile
         f. You have removed any component from the browser package
         g. You have edited or removed text or script files (including license
            files, readmes, JavaScript modules, etc.)
         h. The binaries have been in any way infected with or include a virus,
            trojan, or other malware
         i. The binaries and program structure have been in any way obscured
            (e.g. by using application virtualization) making it difficult or
            impossible to check for the previously listed alterations
   4. The binaries can be obtained without the use of third-party software not
      officially endorsed, including but not limited to: download managers,
      stub installers, wrappers, proprietary clients or proprietary protocols.
      This includes any offering of such unendorsed downloading software or
      methods, regardless of offering "direct" downloads or allowed methods
      alongside the unendorsed ones.
   5. The binaries are not supplied as an integral part of a commercial/non-
      commercial software package/larger works ("package"). If you wish to do
      this, you must contact me beforehand to obtain permission and discuss
      terms. Inclusion in a package will be subject to an individual agreement
      (either extemporaneous or legalized) which may or may not involve
      compensation.
   6. The binaries are not supplied as an integral part of a commercial/non-
      commercial website/web service/on-line venue/etc. ("service"). If you
      wish to do this, you must contact me beforehand to obtain permission and
      discuss terms. Inclusion in a service will be subject to an individual
      agreement (either extemporaneous or legalized) which may or may not
      involve compensation.
   7. An exception applies to points 5 and 6 of this license for  educational
      purposes if bundled with other open source software or supplied as part
      of a curriculum or in-college resource for students.
   8. An exception applies to point 5 of this license for inclusion of the
      officially branded binaries in freely available and fully Open Source
      operating systems, including but not limited to non-commercial variants
      of Linux, variants of BSD and ReactOS. This exception only applies to
      unaltered versions of the Pale Moon binaries or officially branded
      variants specifically built for the target operating system from source
      that have not been materially changed (including brand-specific
      configurations like e.g. home page, default search engine). If any of the
      essential settings of the browser are altered beyond what is strictly
      needed for providing a working build on the target operating system, the
      exception in this point does not apply and the license defaults to point
      10, instead.
         1. Clarification of "officially branded variants specifically built
            for the target operating system": If an officially-built binary
            (i.e. built by our team) is available for the target operating
            system (e.g. existing Linux binaries), then those binaries will
            always, in principle, take precedence over a third-party build to
            ensure necessary QA and compatibility. Building and distributing a
            binary with official branding is in that situation only in
            principle allowed if an actual variant build is required for the
            target distribution's compatibility (e.g. kernel or library
            requirements) or operation, and otherwise not impacting the
            material content of the browser package as a whole. QA of and
            support for the resulting variant binaries will in that case fall
            on the maintainer who will have to take full responsibility for the
            variant binary.
   9. This redistribution agreement and any Individual Agreements for the
      redistribution of executable code are provided by Moonchild Productions
      ("Moonchild", "M.C. Straver") explicitly for the Pale Moon executable
      code, and not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. The Initial
      Developer and every Contributor is hereby indemnified for any liability
      incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
      these terms.
  10. The only exception to this redistribution policy not otherwise covered in
      points 7 or 8 is if the repackaged or private build with official
      branding has been pre-approved by Moonchild for redistribution and is
      listed on this website as a contributed build. Contributed builds are
      subject to a screening process, may be accepted or rejected, may be re-
      screened at a later time, and may be at any time removed, in Moonchild's
      sole discretion, either with or without stated reason.
  11. If a distribution is authorized as per point 10, the contributed build
      may be redistributed in unaltered form by third parties as set out in the
      points above and under the same conditions.
  12. If you wish to distribute binaries for other platforms, building from
      Pale Moon source code, you may not use official branding unless these
      builds have also been approved as a contributed build as per point 10 of
      this license or if they are exempt under points 7 or 8 of this license.
      Even so, you obtain no rights to the Pale Moon name or logo, merely the
      permission to use it for the 3rd party build, and only for as long as it
      is officially endorsed or satisfies the conditions for exemption. In all
      other cases you must use significantly different branding files/graphics
      and a significantly different name for the browser.
  13. Unofficial branding ("New Moon") as supplied in the source code may be
      used for unendorsed binaries at all times. Thusly branded binaries with
      the New Moon logo and product name are not subject to the endorsement and
      exception rules as set out in previous points of this license and may be
      freely distributed in altered or unaltered form, subject to the Mozilla
      Public License as regards source code changes and availability. This
      permission does, however, not include any rights or license to the Pale
      Moon name and logo that may still be present in the resulting
      unofficially branded binaries.

non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
-------------------------------------------

  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
  License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
  file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
